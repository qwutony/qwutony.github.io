# Trading Patterns
There are some patterns that can be used for effective trading with known profit/loss scenarios.

## Swing Failure Pattern (False Breakout)
Actionable for both long and short.

Take the counter trade when momentum is lost following a liquidity grab and retraces into the pre-breakout zone. Take profits at or near liquidity levels.

In this chart, a large green candle formed a potential breakout of the previous liquidity zone of $61,235. This large green candle could either be due to a lack of orders or because of significant buying interest. The breakout fails and retreats to the previous liquidity zone, where we can enter a trade expecting a complete retracement. Place stop loss at new highs for risk management.

A similar long setup is shown above. The reason for this is that during consolidation periods where price stagnates, institutions would attempt to hunt liquidity zones to get better fills on their positions. They will set an iceberg order or other mechanism to drive prices towards a certain liquidity zone, and then trigger all the stop losses there to fill their own orders. Take profit is set to the next liquidity zone that the market approaches, as likely buying/selling presence will be significantly diminished as the stock will be considered over/undervalued.
