# Trading Patterns
There are some patterns that can be used for effective trading with known profit/loss scenarios.

## Swing Failure Pattern (False Breakout)
Actionable for both long and short.

Take the counter trade when momentum is lost following a liquidity grab and retraces into the pre-breakout zone. Take profits at or near liquidity levels.

In this chart, a large green candle formed a potential breakout of the previous liquidity zone of $61,235. This large green candle could either be due to a lack of orders or because of significant buying interest. The breakout fails and retreats to the previous liquidity zone, where we can enter a trade expecting a complete retracement. Place stop loss at new highs for risk management.
