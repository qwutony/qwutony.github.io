# Trading Patterns
There are some patterns that can be used for effective trading with known profit/loss scenarios.

## Swing Failure Pattern (False Breakout)
Actionable for both long and short.

Take the counter trade when momentum is lost following a liquidity grab and retraces into the pre-breakout zone. Take profits at or near liquidity levels.

In this chart, a large green candle formed a potential breakout of the previous liquidity zone of $61,235. This large green candle could either be due to a lack of orders or because of significant buying interest. The breakout fails and retreats to the previous liquidity zone, where we can enter a trade expecting a complete retracement. Place stop loss at new highs for risk management.

A similar long setup is shown above.

Another example of perfect liquidity engineering by institutional investors to get the long fill.

**Reason**: During consolidation periods where price stagnates, institutions would attempt to hunt liquidity zones to get better fills on their positions. They will set an iceberg order or other mechanism to drive prices towards a certain liquidity zone, and then trigger all the stop losses there to fill their own orders. Take profit is set to the next liquidity zone that the market approaches, as likely buying/selling presence will be significantly diminished as the stock will be considered over/undervalued.

## Intermediate Zone Liquidity Sweep
Actionable during a breakout and strong trend.

Take a trade in the direction of the breakout when previous liquidity built during the intermediate range is swept. We must see a willingness to go higher with strong demand.

There must be a willingness to buy - either through strong and rapid price movement to break above the liquidity zone, or through the formation of a strong pattern like a flag or pennant formation.

**Reason**: Flags are created as liquidity is constantly swept, as institutions and early traders take their initial profits. They will often leave runners which allow for a second impulse move. If enough liquidity is swept this will encourage the completion of the move.

## Inverse Head and Shoulders (Right Shoulder Formation)
Actionable when two impulses are absorbed, the second impulse retraces significantly, and the third impulse (right shoulder) should form.

Take a trade in the direction of the inverse head and shoulder pattern and take profit at the next liquidity zone.

**Reason**: The first impulse indicates a slowing down in selling momentum, the second impulse completes the selling momentum, and the third impulse should fail to break the lows of the second impulse to indicate a momentum shift. If we break the lows, or if the right shoulder becomes too steep it will indicate a failure in this pattern.

We must anticipate the formation of the right shoulder and not the breakout because often times this pattern in unreliable during the breakout and if momentum shifts again at least we had an early entry to take partial profits.

## Untapped Liquidity Sweep
Actionable by noticing a build up of choppy movement - this indicates an area of liquidity build up that needs to be resolved.

Take a trade that cleans up the untapped liquidity zones. No entry is provided here as it may take a long time for these liquidity zones to be cleaned up.

**Reason**: An accumulation of buyers and sellers failed to make a decision here, leaving untapped liquidity in the form of potential stop losses. Institutions can leverage this trapped liquidity to add to their positions.

## False Breakdown (Avoid Trading)
A false breakdown is a rapid movement during the consolidation phase to sweep liquidity that was built early after market open. A strong and violent movement against the prevailing trend occurs that is usually dissipated after a 5-20 minute move. This is standard liquidity engineering to get large orders to fill by hunting and absorbing as much liquidity as possible in the early market phase.

The white lines represent all the potential liquidity zones that have been absorbed. As these lows are repaired, the market can now go higher.
