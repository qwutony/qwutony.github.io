# Trading Patterns
There are some patterns that can be used for effective trading with known profit/loss scenarios.

**Trading Hypothesis**

Retail traders are the unaware cohort that serves as unwilling liquidity providers to the market. The true players are the institutional investors, hedge funds and other funds, large corporations and banks and the government.

The movement of most large investors cannot be determined since they either trickle their purchases and sales, or they buy through dark pools that are untraceable to individual investors. Insitutional traders leave a significant footprint as they need to generate liquidity for entries and exits, often at the cost and expense of retail traders.

Take for example a retail trader who buys when a breakout occurs. A strong momentum occurs and a lot of traders attempt to capitalise on the signal by entering long. This is the perfect position for institutional investors to get their large sell order in by taking the opposite position against the retail horde. The momentum wanes and the stock falls fast allowing the institutional investor to quickly profit.

An institutional trader also needs liquidity engineering for the perfect exit to minimise slippage. They can engineer a scenario to fill their orders, by creating a large sell order at a certain level, or an iceberg sell order that "encourages" retail traders or those that read the order book to take a short position. Once they reach a certain liquidity zone, the institutional trader can then trigger the stop losses and then distribute their large short to the retail longs, hence creating a swing failure pattern.

## Swing Failure Pattern (False Breakout)
Actionable for both long and short.

Take the counter trade when momentum is lost following a liquidity grab and retraces into the pre-breakout zone. Take profits at or near liquidity levels.

In this chart, a large green candle formed a potential breakout of the previous liquidity zone of $61,235. This large green candle could either be due to a lack of orders or because of significant buying interest. The breakout fails and retreats to the previous liquidity zone, where we can enter a trade expecting a complete retracement. Place stop loss at new highs for risk management.

A similar long setup is shown above.

Another example of perfect liquidity engineering by institutional investors to get the long fill.

**Reason**: During consolidation periods where price stagnates, institutions would attempt to hunt liquidity zones to get better fills on their positions. They will set an iceberg order or other mechanism to drive prices towards a certain liquidity zone, and then trigger all the stop losses there to fill their own orders. Take profit is set to the next liquidity zone that the market approaches, as likely buying/selling presence will be significantly diminished as the stock will be considered over/undervalued.

## Intermediate Zone Liquidity Sweep
Actionable during a breakout and strong trend.

Take a trade in the direction of the breakout when previous liquidity built during the intermediate range is swept. We must see a willingness to go higher with strong demand.

There must be a willingness to buy - either through strong and rapid price movement to break above the liquidity zone, or through the formation of a strong pattern like a flag or pennant formation.

**Reason**: Flags are created as liquidity is constantly swept, as institutions and early traders take their initial profits. They will often leave runners which allow for a second impulse move. If enough liquidity is swept this will encourage the completion of the move.

## Inverse Head and Shoulders (Right Shoulder Formation)
Actionable when two impulses are absorbed, the second impulse retraces significantly, and the third impulse (right shoulder) should form.

Take a trade in the direction of the inverse head and shoulder pattern and take profit at the next liquidity zone.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04824d88-fdff-48de-8c78-366043970df9)

**Reason**: The first impulse indicates a slowing down in selling momentum, the second impulse completes the selling momentum, and the third impulse should fail to break the lows of the second impulse to indicate a momentum shift. If we break the lows, or if the right shoulder becomes too steep it will indicate a failure in this pattern.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e7a1ac6-0582-44b9-92ec-8c8df1998ab4)

We must anticipate the formation of the right shoulder and not the breakout because often times this pattern in unreliable during the breakout and if momentum shifts again at least we had an early entry to take partial profits.

## Intermediate Untapped Liquidity Sweep
Actionable by noticing a build up of choppy movement - this indicates an area of liquidity build up that needs to be resolved.

Take a trade that cleans up the untapped liquidity zones. No entry is provided here as it may take a long time for these liquidity zones to be cleaned up.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61f3605d-ed78-4e0a-8a16-f7b709a0bb6c)

**Reason**: An accumulation of buyers and sellers failed to make a decision here, leaving untapped liquidity in the form of potential stop losses. Institutions can leverage this trapped liquidity to add to their positions.

## Double Tops and Double Bottoms (Unfinished Business)
Actionable by noticing an incomplete market auction around the highs (double tops) or lows (double bottoms). Markets are saving this liquidity so they can be taken out significantly at a later stage. Traders that are long from there will have stop losses below the lows, and if price triggers these stop losses, it will cause longs to liquidate, creating strong selling momentum for a continuation past the lows.

If we have an existing short position that is nearing these imperfect lows, we can expect these to be eventually taken out.

## Gaps (Unfinished Business)
Actionable by noticing gaps in the price action for certain markets (for indices ETFs, it is not expected for all gaps to fill, however 70% of gaps do eventually fill). Therefore, gap entrances and gap fills serve as support and resistance levels, and also potential levels for SFP.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc5480f2-727a-4c70-b8c8-e77f3cb729f0)

A trader can long and expect to take profit around the gap fill, and conversely a trader can look for a swing failure pattern to enter short after the gap is filled.

**Reason**: Gaps are liquidity voids where no market auction has taken place at these price levels. This violates efficient market theory which suggests that every price historically should be auctioned at all prices.

ChatGPT: According to the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), all available information should be reflected in the asset's price, and every price should have been tested by the market, ensuring that there are no untraded or untested price levels. Similarly, Auction Market Theory suggests that the market seeks to find a balance between supply and demand by auctioning prices at various levels until an equilibrium is reached.

## Horizontal Bull Flag
Actionable by recognising a strong period of horizontal consolidation after an initial upward thrust. This indicates that there might be more favourable price action to come.

Horizontal bull flags are rare, but offer a unique opportunity since we can assign a stop loss right beneath the bottom of the consolidation anticipating a breakout that yields high R:R.

## False Breakdown (Avoid Trading)
A false breakdown is a rapid movement during the consolidation phase to sweep liquidity that was built early after market open. A strong and violent movement against the prevailing trend occurs that is usually dissipated after a 5-20 minute move. This is standard liquidity engineering to get large orders to fill by hunting and absorbing as much liquidity as possible in the early market phase.

The white lines represent all the potential liquidity zones that have been absorbed. As these lows are repaired, the market can now go higher.

## Real World Examples

### Micro S&P500 LTF Short (13/08/24 Pre-market Open)

The price of the MES took out the previous daily high, which serves as a resistance and a place to look for an SFP trade. We took an initial short position after the breakdown, which is incorrect - it is better to wait for a consolidation or retrace first. This is because a real change of direction requires a certain amount of distribution. The second short was successful and price went down for over half an hour.

Due to time restrictions it was not possible to monitor the price after profit was taken, but the price made a subsequent retracement to the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, which opened up another potential short after the first breakdown red candle. Take profit would be the -0.618 and -1 expansion levels.

### Micro S&P500 LTF Short (13/08/24 Lunch)

Another potential resistance level + SFP opportunity arose, as this level was the high of a previous liquidity area during a sell-off. Price usually stagnates around here with a potential to retrace to digest the upward movement from earlier in the day. A cautious short was taken, but do take note that this is risky because the market was in full bullish mode during the day. During bullish days keep longs long and shorts short.

A consolidation occurred which resembled a bull flag, this lowered the probability of success significantly and stop loss was almost imminent. However, there was a rapid bull flag breakdown which allowed hitting the take profit target before strong buying demand resumed. Again, the lesson here is that an immediate SFP is often a poor decision, and we should wait for a distribution pattern to form before taking the appropriate position.
