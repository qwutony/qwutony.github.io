  - CVD Divergences
  - SMA and EMAs
  - Open Interest
  - Daily Volume and Delta
  - Funding
  - Set up all possible trade setups (Bullish or Bearish)

### Confluence
  - Determine multiple confluences
  - Use multiple technical analysis tools to determine if they intersect around an area
  - Increase the probability of trading using multiple confluences and simple invalidation

### Swing Failure Pattern
  - Wait for highs/lows of range to be taken and determine if there is a reversal into the range.
  - Wait for a retrace (using Fibonacci), to determine entry and take profit near the POC or bottom of range.

### Fibonacci Levels
  - Use these levels for confluence, but also determining take profit levels with negative Fibonacci levels.
  - Do not use these as potential SLs.

## Consolidation Trading
  - Consolidation above support is bullish, Consolidation below resistance is bearish.
  - Observe BuF and BeF (Bull Flag and Bear Flags)
  - Sideways Consolidation (Neutral)
  - Sloping Channels (Can be unsustainable and broken)

## Compounding Trading
  - If position moves favourably, can look to add contracts at strong confluence levels.
  - If position moves unfavourably, can look to add contracts at strong confluence levels and close AT BREAKEVEN to recover trade. Use only in exceptional cases.
  - Laddering - entering into positions and exiting positions as a ladder and not all at once (ET1, ET2, ET3, TP1, TP2, TP3)
