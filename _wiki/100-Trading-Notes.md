  - Set up all possible trade setups (Bullish or Bearish)

### Confluence
  - Determine multiple confluences
  - Use multiple technical analysis tools to determine if they intersect around an area
  - Increase the probability of trading using multiple confluences and simple invalidation

## Consolidation Trading
  - Consolidation above support is bullish, Consolidation below resistance is bearish.
  - Observe BuF and BeF (Bull Flag and Bear Flags)
  - Sideways Consolidation (Neutral)
  - Sloping Channels (Can be unsustainable and broken)

## Compounding Trading
  - If position moves favourably, can look to add contracts at strong confluence levels.
  - If position moves unfavourably, can look to add contracts at strong confluence levels and close AT BREAKEVEN to recover trade. Use only in exceptional cases.
  - Laddering - entering into positions and exiting positions as a ladder and not all at once (ET1, ET2, ET3, TP1, TP2, TP3)
