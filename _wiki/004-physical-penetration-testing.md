# Physical Penetration Testing
Covert entry strategies to allow attackers to bypass physical security mechanisms to gain unauthorized entry to a building. Resources retrieved from various talks - credit provided below.

## Hinge Removal

**Requires:** Nail and Hammer

**Targets:** Hinge Pin

**Remediation:** Security Hinges and Jamb Pin Screws

## Door Latch

**Requires:** Latch Tool, Wires to bypass protective plates

**Targets:** Door Latches

**Remediation:** Dead Latch mechanism and not protective plates
  - Rely on the correct door fitment

## Crash Bars

Also known as push bars, panic bars or exit devices - used to allow quick egress in case of emergency. Consists of a horizontal bar spanning the width of the door that can be pushed from the inside to ensure a fast and efficient escape route.

**Vulnerability:** Weather stripping (such as brush or rubber) in between the crash bars is not a security mechanism and is different to a security plate. This can be exploited by slipping an object through to open the crash bar.

**Requires:** Bend Rod or other long object

**Targets:** Crash Bar

**Remediation:** Dead Latch mechanism and not protective plates
