# Physical Penetration Testing
Covert entry strategies to allow attackers to bypass physical security mechanisms to gain unauthorized entry to a building. Resources retrieved from various talks - credit provided below.

## Hinge Removal
Hinge removal is a common vulnerability in door security where an attacker removes the hinge pins, allowing the door to be lifted off its hinges.

**Requires:** 
  - Nail and Hammer
    - Basic tools that can be used to drive out the hinge pins from standard door hinges.

**Targets:** Hinge Pins

**Remediations:** 
  - Security Hinges
    - Use hinges with non-removable pins.
    - Opt for hinges with set screws that hold the pin in place.
    - 
  - Jamb Pin Screws
    - Install jamb pin screws in the door and frame. These are screws that extend from the door into the frame, preventing the door from being lifted off even if the hinge pins are removed.
  - Reinforced Hinge Plates
    - Use reinforced hinge plates that provide additional security and make it more difficult to access and remove the pins.  

## Door Latch
Door latches can be vulnerable to unauthorized access if manipulated with specialized tools.

**Requires:** 
  - Latch Tool (A specialized tool used to manipulate the latch mechanism of a door)
  - Wires (Thin wires or other tools used to bypass protective plates and access the latch mechanism directly)

**Targets:** Door Latches (can be manipulated to open the door without a key or proper access)

**Remediation:** 
  - Dead Latch mechanism
    - This mechanism engages a secondary latch that locks the primary latch in place, making it more resistant to tampering
  - Correct door fitment
    - Ensure that the door is properly fitted within its frame. A well-fitted door reduces gaps and spaces that can be exploited to manipulate the latch. Proper fitment also ensures that the dead latch mechanism functions correctly
  - Use of protective plates can be bypassed

## Crash Bars
Also known as push bars, panic bars or exit devices - used to allow quick egress in case of emergency. Consists of a horizontal bar spanning the width of the door that can be pushed from the inside to ensure a fast and efficient escape route.

**Vulnerability:** Weather stripping (such as brush or rubber) in between the crash bars is not a security mechanism and is different to a security plate. This can be exploited by slipping an object through to open the crash bar.

**Requires:** Bend Rod or other long object

**Targets:** Crash Bar

**Remediation:** Dead Latch mechanism and not protective plates
